Hello, my name is Purusottam Banerjee and I am a software developer with experience working on a variety of projects. I have worked with several programming languages such as 
JAVA, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and have experience in designing, developing and managing both NoSQL and relational databases.

Apart from database management, my primary area of interest is web development and software development. I have developed several web applications using various front-end and
back-end frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Express.js. I have experience working with APIs and integrating third-party services.

I am passionate about building high-quality software that solves real-world problems and provides value to users. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to
learn new technologies and improve my skills as a developer. I have a strong focus on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code that can be easily modified and extended.

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with me, please feel free to email me at rahulban2014@gmail.com . Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!
